## Applications

Kodkod is used in a wide range of applications, including
bounded verification, program synthesis, declarative
execution, and specification analysis.  This page lists some of the
<a href="#tools-built-on-kodkod">tools</a> and
<a href="#theses-using-kodkod">theses</a> that are based on Kodkod.
For papers citing Kodkod, follow the "cited by" links on
the [publications](pubs.html) page.

### Tools Built on Kodkod
